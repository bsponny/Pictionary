# Pictionary

## What this program does

This program is to help aid in a game of pictionary or charades. This is the substitute for the bowl of papers with things to draw/act out. These words will get pulled from a list of words that can be added by a `.txt` file in the `docs` subdirectory. This will be used by the program to play the game.

## How to add a list of words

To use this program to the fullest ability, the user can create their own list of words to be used. Simply create a `.txt` file with each word on its own line such as this,

```
Ball
Book
Bucket
Toothbrush
```
This can then be saved as `objects.txt` in the `docs/` directory and then the program will be able to find it and use it in the next batch of words to print.
